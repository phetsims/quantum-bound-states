/**
 * QBSColors defines colors that are used throughout this simulation.
 *
 * All simulations should have a Colors.js file, see https://github.com/phetsims/scenery-phet/issues/642.
 *
 * For static colors that are used in more than one place, add them here.
 *
 * For dynamic colors that can be controlled via colorProfileProperty.js, add instances of ProfileColorProperty here,
 * each of which is required to have a default color. Note that dynamic colors can be edited by running the sim from
 * phetmarks using the "Color Edit" mode.
