/**
 * Physical constants for quantum mechanics calculations.
 * Note that we use SI units throughout this simulation.
 * For 64 bits IEEE 754, the maximum value is approximately 10³⁰⁸ while for
 * 32-bit IEEE 754, the maximum value is approximately 10³⁸.
 * As a result for 64 bit computation, we have the luxury of being able to
 * keep everything with SI units, without having to worry about overflow
 * when using these constants.
